# ShinyMutationExplorer

## TODO

- add help entries, e.g. using the shinyhelper package
- don't allow plot download when no plot available (e.g. no gene selected)
- only redrawing when more genes are being selected, see https://code.i-harness.com/en/q/1db7c1c for an example
- modify the download mutation table according to the selections
- increase plot size as more plots are selected

# ShinyMutationExplorer

## TODO

- fix file save button name suggestions
- add help entries, e.g. using the shinyhelper package
- don't allow plot download when no plot available (e.g. no gene selected)
- only y redrawing when more genes are being selected, see https://code.i-harness.com/en/q/1db7c1c for an example

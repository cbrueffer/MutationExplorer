# The Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network--Breast (SCAN-B)

The Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network--Breast (SCAN-B) initiative (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [NCT02306096](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02306096)) is a population-based, multicenter breast cancer study that started enrolling patients in 2010.
The study is described in [Saal *et al*, Genome Medicine (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-015-0131-9) and [Ryd√©n *et al*, British Journal of Surgery (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10741).

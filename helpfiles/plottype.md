# Plot Type

Select for which type of data to show Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The options are as follows:

- Mutated Genes

  Select up to 9 genes by their HUGO symbols.

- Mutated Pathways

  Pathways, either defined in the Reactome database, or custom.  A pathway is defined as mutated if at least one member gene has a mutation.

- Tumor Mutation Burden

  All samples stratified into *High* or *Low* tumor mutation burden defined by a cutoff.  Only non-synonymous mutations are considered.

- Landscape

  Mutational landscape waterfall plot showing the top N mutated genes (default: 20), their mutation types, as well as clinical annotations.
